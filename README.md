Taskzoid


## What is the Taskzoid?
Taskzoid is an android app that will help a user to manage day-to-day tasks. The Taskzoid consists of a very easy and effective UI with great UX.


## Idea:
Everyone wan to increase their work efficiency and want to do more and more work in a short span of time. We always decide to do particular work at a time. For example, possibly everyone decides every night that I have to do this much work tomorrow. But we all know how much we'll do? So better to write down every single task in the Taskzoid right now with possibly due time and try to finish it within due time.
Apart from this if you have to finish a big task or project then surely you have to be more concerned about subtasks which will eventually build up the whole big task. This app will help you to track down that small tasks.
This app will help you as a cure-all if you have this problem.

## About Project:
This is a very simple project without any rocket science BTS. A new user will easily figure out all the sections within a minute.

## Different Sections in the project:
### 1. Home Screen
Here you'll found the list of all the tasks added so far. Since each task has a separate priority.
Here mainly I have categorized the tasks in three different priorities
1. High - Solid Red Color
2. Medium - Yellow Color
3. Low - Bluish Color

### Operations:
-- If you have done a particular task, you can delete it just by clicking the radio button.
-- You can edit a particular task just by clicking on it. You can easily edit the name, due date, and even priorities.

### 2. Add a new Task

Click on the Floating Action Button (FAB) in the bottom right corner. This will pop up a new activity.

Enter the task name.
Click on the Calendar button to choose the due date. This will pop up on the calendar.
By default, the due date is the current date
Click the flag icon To assign a priority to the task. The default priority is low in case you have forgotten.
Click on the upload button to 

### 3. Main Menu:
Although a lot of functionalities can be added in these sections like login, logout, settings for customization, etc. But here you'll find about section only right now.

## Used tools and Technologies
Technologies: Java 8, Android Room Database, XML, Android MVC Pattern
Platform: Android Studio

## Future Scope and Enhancements
Add Trash for deleted tasks. This will help to secure data and decrease the data losing capabilities.
Add login, logout functionalities, and add a particular session for a different user so that more than one user can use this in a single android.
Add alarm system. Whenever a particular task has exceeded the due date then notify the user about it by ringing the android for a certain amount of time.
Improve UI.
